   JaPoker is a Java Poker game. It supports several poker variants (see table
   below), and from 2 to 14 players (depending on the variant). Players can
   at present either be local human players, or one of three primitive
   computer-controlled players. 
  </p>
  <p>
   JaPoker requires Java version 1.6 or greater to run,
   which can be obtained from
   <a href="http://www.java.com/">www.java.com</a>.
