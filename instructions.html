   A poker <em>hand</em> is a set of five cards. There are nine standard categories
   of hand, described below. Hands are compared first by category, then by individual
   cards &mdash; the lowest possible straight flush will always beat the highest
   possible four of a kind, for example.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Straight Flush</h4>
  <div class="hand">

   <p class="desc">Ten-high straight flush</p>
  </div>
  <div class="handinfo">
   <p>
    A straight flush is a hand that has five sequential cards of the same suit.
    The lowest possible straight flush is A-2-3-4-5, while the highest
    (normally called a Royal Flush) is T-J-Q-K-A. Aces may be high or low, but
    not both (Q-K-A-2-3 is <em>not</em> a valid straight). The suit of the
    flush is irrelevant &mdash; T-J-Q-K-A of hearts is equal to T-J-Q-K-A of
    clubs, spades or diamonds.
   </p>
   <p>
    The hand is normally described by the highest card &mdash; a royal flush is
    "ace-high", 5-6-7-8-9 would be "nine-high".
   </p>
  </div>
  
  <h4>Four of a kind</h4>
  <div class="hand">
   <img src="res/dace.png" alt="Ace of diamonds">
   <img src="res/cace.png" alt="Ace of clubs">
   <img src="res/hace.png" alt="Ace of hearts">

   <img src="res/hking.png" alt="King of hearts">
   <p class="desc">Four tens</p>
  </div><div class="handinfo">
  <p>
   A hand containing all four cards of one rank (such as 4-4-4-4-7 or
   K-K-K-K-5) is classed as a 'four of a kind'. The 'spare' card is known as
   the <a href="#gloss-kicker">kicker</a>, and isn't used when comparing
   two hands with four of a kind. The higher the rank of the four cards,
   the better the hand.
  </p> 
  </div>
  
  <h4>Full house</h4>
  <div class="hand">
   <img src="res/hfour.png" alt="Four of hearts">

   <img src="res/hace.png" alt="Ace of hearts">
   <p class="desc">Aces among threes</p>
  </div><div class="handinfo">
  <p>
   A full house is a hand that contains three cards of one rank, and two
   of another, such as A-A-A-3-3. Full houses are compared by the set of
   three cards (e.g., 3-3-3-4-4 beats 2-2-2-K-K), and are described by
   both sets of cards &mdash; a hand of 3-3-3-4-4 would normally be
   described as "fours among threes", or sometimes "threes over fours".
  </p>
  </div>
  
  <h4>Flush</h4>
  <div class="hand">
   <img src="res/ddeuce.png" alt="Deuce of diamonds">
   <img src="res/dseven.png" alt="Seven of diamonds">
   <img src="res/dnine.png" alt="Nine of diamonds">

   <img src="res/ceight.png" alt="Eight of clubs">
   <p class="desc">K-Q-J-9-8 flush</p>
  </div>
  <div class="handinfo">
  <p>
   A flush is a hand of five cards that all belong to the same suit. Any
   set of five cards of the same suit makes a flush (except for a set of
   five sequential cards, which would make a <em>straight flush</em>).
   Flushes are compared by each individual card, from high to low.
  </p>
  </div>
  
  <h4>Straight</h4>
  <div class="hand">
   <img src="res/dten.png" alt="Ten of diamonds">
   <img src="res/sjack.png" alt="Jack of spades">
   <img src="res/squeen.png" alt="Queen of spades">
   <img src="res/hking.png" alt="King of hearts">
   <img src="res/sace.png" alt="Ace of spades">
   <p class="desc">Ace-high straight</p>

   <img src="res/cseven.png" alt="Seven of clubs">
   <img src="res/seight.png" alt="Eight of spades">
   <img src="res/hnine.png" alt="Nine of hearts">
   <img src="res/cten.png" alt="Ten of clubs">
   <p class="desc">Ten-high straight</p>
  </div><div class="handinfo">
  <p>
   A straight is a hand of five cards in sequential order, of any suit
   (but not all of the same suit; that would be a straight flush).
   Straights are described and compared by their highest card, for
   example a hand of 4-5-6-7-8 would be described as "eight-high", and
   would beat a "seven-high" straight.
  </p>
  </div>

  <h4>Three of a kind</h4>
  <div class="hand">
   <img src="res/dten.png" alt="Ten of diamonds">
   <img src="res/cten.png" alt="Ten of clubs">
   <img src="res/sten.png" alt="Ten of spades">
   <img src="res/hking.png" alt="King of hearts">
   <img src="res/sace.png" alt="Ace of spades">
   <p class="desc">Three tens</p>
   <p class="beats">... beats ... </p>
   <img src="res/dsix.png" alt="Six of diamonds">
   <img src="res/csix.png" alt="Six of clubs">
   <img src="res/ssix.png" alt="Six of spades">
   <img src="res/hnine.png" alt="Nine of hearts">
   <img src="res/cten.png" alt="Ten of clubs">
   <p class="desc">Three sixes</p>
  </div><div class="handinfo">
  <p>
   A hand containing three cards of one rank, and two other, different
   cards (if they were the same, it would make a full house), such as A-A-A-3-4
   is classed as a three of a kind. Three of a kinds are described and
   compared by the set of three cards - A-A-A-3-4 is described as
   "three aces", and beats any other three of a kind hand.
  </p>
  </div>

  <h4>Two pair</h4>
  <div class="hand">
  </div><div class="handinfo">
  <p>
   A two-pair hand contains two (different) pairs of cards, and one kicker.
   Two pair hands are compared by their highest pair, then their lowest pair,
   then the kicker. For example, A-A-2-2-K beats Q-Q-J-J-T, which beats
   Q-Q-T-T-J, which beats Q-Q-T-T-9.
  </p>
  </div>
  
  <h4>One pair</h4>
  <div class="hand">
  </div><div class="handinfo">
  <p>
   A hand conaining only one pair of cards are classed as "one pair", and
   are compared first by their pair of cards, then by each of the three kickers
   individually.
  </p>
  </div>

  <h4>No pair</h4>
  <div class="hand">
  </div><div class="handinfo">
  <p>
   Any other set of five cards is classed as "no pair", and each card is
   compared individually, from high to low.

  <h2 id="games">The games</h2>
  <h3 id="games-texas">Texas Hold'Em</h3>
  <p>
   Texas Hold'Em is the most popular poker variant played in casinos worldwide.
   It is a <em>community card game</em>, which means that there are some cards
   (the 'community cards') that are shared by all players. The aim of Texas
   Hold'Em is to finish the game with the best <a href="#poker-hands">hand</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
   In Texas Hold'Em, each player is dealt two <a href="#gloss-hole">hole cards</a>.
   After an initial betting round, three community cards are revealed (called
   <a href="#gloss-flop">the flop</a>). A further betting round then takes place,
   and a fourth community card (<a href="#gloss-turn">the turn</a>) is dealt.
   After another betting round, the final community card
   (<a href="#gloss-turn">the river</a>) is dealt, and one final betting round
   takes place.
  </p>
  <p>
   After the final betting round is over, each player reveals their cards
   (called the <a href="#gloss-showdown">showdown</a>). The player with the
   best <a href="#poker-hands">poker hand</a> wins the content of the pot.
  </p>
  <h3 id="games-royal">Royal Hold'Em</h3>
  <p>
   Royal Hold'Em is a variant of <a href="#games-texas">Texas Hold'Em</a>.
   It is played in an identical manner, but the deck is <a href="#gloss-stripped">stripped</a> of all cards
   below tens (i.e., the deck only contains tens, jacks, queens, kings and aces).
  </p>
  <h3 id="games-5stud">Five Card Stud</h3>
  <h3 id="games-7stud">Seven Card Stud</h3>
  <h3 id="games-omaha">Omaha Hold'Em</h3>
  <h3 id="games-omahahl">Omhaha High/Low</h3>
  <h3 id="games-courch">Courchevel</h3>
  <h3 id="games-super">Super Hold'Em</h3>
  <p>
   Super Hold'Em is a variant of <a href="#games-texas">Texas Hold'Em</a>.
   It is played in an identical manner, but instead of two
   <a href="#gloss-hole">hole cards</a> each player has three.
   The game is similar to <a href="#game-pineapple">Pineapple</a> and
   <a href="#game-crazy">Crazy Pineapple</a>, where players start with
   three cards and discard one at some point in the game.
  </p>
  <h3 id="games-5draw">Five Card Draw</h3>
  <h3 id="game-pineapple">Pineapple</h3>
  <p>
   Pineapple is a variant of <a href="#games-texas">Texas Hold'Em</a>.
   Each player starts with three <a href="#gloss-hole">hole cards</a> instead
   of two, and chooses one to discard before the first betting round.
  </p>
  <h3 id="games-crazy">Crazy Pineapple</h3>
  <p>
   Crazy pineapple is a variant of <a href="#games-pineapple">Pineapple</a>.
   As in Pineapple, each player starts with three <a href="#gloss-hole">hold cards</a>,
   but they keep all three cards until after the <a href="#gloss-flop">flop</a>; after
   which they chose one to discard.
